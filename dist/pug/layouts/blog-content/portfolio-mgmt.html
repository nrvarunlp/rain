          The Golden, Ugly, and Often Times Complicated Truth of Profitable
          Portfolio Management
        </h1><img class="blog-img3" src="images/golden-ugly.jpeg" style="width:100%;"/>
        <p class="para-blog2">“Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;<br/> knock, and it shall be
          								opened unto you”- Matthew 7:7–8<br/><br/>								You were probably not expecting a quote from the Bible to spearhead an article on
          								profitable portfolio management, but that’s besides the point. The quote is relevant
          								because it paints a truth about life in plain and stark terms: you will find what you’re
          								looking for.<br/><br/>								OK, it might not be quite that simple. I cannot begin trading and proclaim: I am
          								guaranteed to make money trading today! But I can find what I’m looking for, meaning, I
          								fully validate and justify any trading strategy based on historical, past information.<br/><br/>								Let me repeat that in more direct terms. Suppose I have a hypothesis: when the US dollar
          								falls 5% against the Pound during a given time-span, I will buy the Greenback and sell
          								the Pound. The next, logical step is to pull up market data and begin
          								back-testing — that is, to simulate my strategy on past data and extrapolate how well my
          								strategy would have performed in the past. Any experienced quantitative trader will
          								unabashedly tell you that if you spend enough time, the market data will only validate
          								your hypothesis. Your strategy has a very good chance at having succeeded in the past.<br/><br/>								How is that possible?<br/><br/>								In Classical/Traditional Game Theory, the assumption is that rationality is king. If
          								you’ve watched A Beautiful Mind, starring Russell Crowe, the character’s breakthrough
          								comes from discovering the Nash Equilibrium, which is a state wherein participants are
          								in a state of equilibrium and cease to take any further actions, based on the fact that
          								this is a mutual best response, meaning, at this point in time, it does not make any
          								sense for either party to take any further action based on the rational premise that
          								each actor is aware of the rationality of the other individuals in the room.But in real
          								life, these states don’t happen in such a discreet manner. Life is fluid, with many
          								unknown actors and variables. In this nice Medium article by Gayatri Sarkar, she writes
          								that although the Nash Equilibrium is a great classical theory on paper, in the stock
          								markets, it simply does not hold up. Instead, a better “all in one” explanation has more
          								to do with probabilities, and less with fixed mathematical “equilibrium” states. In the
          								stock markets, probabilities drive everything, but there’s more at play here than just
          								the way we attempt to describe the behaviors of the market participants.<br/><br/>								Context, in this case, has to do with how we begin to understand how actors go about
          								making their decisions. Rationality is not king. Instead, emotional acts of whimsical
          								disobedience are to be expected.<br/><br/>								Like it or not, this is how the stock markets operate.<br/>								OK great, so context is important when it comes to understanding Game Theory’s relevance
          								in the stock markets. But what does this have to do with our original argument, which is
          								that if you look hard enough, your backtests will inevitably do a very good job in
          								(dangerously) “legitimizing” your hypothesis?<br/><br/>								Because once you realize that the markets are not efficient, then it is your job to
          								discover the inefficiencies. A discovery is done in an organic manner. That’s the very
          								premise of a discovery!<br/><br/>								At first, this may not seem important. But if you think about it, it makes all the
          								difference in the world. Let’s go through an example.<br/><br/>								Mitch is an aspiring quant. Although he’s just 20, he’s wise beyond his years! He loves
          								reading up on company earnings reports in his free time and dabbles with long term
          								investing strategies. One day, he’s looking at a daily chart of Apple and comes across
          								an interesting phenomenon: he can see that, every 5–10 years, Apple’s stock prices form
          								an upward slanting “W” when seen on a daily chart. Not only that, but there is a clear
          								“W” formation being formed right now, an “obvious” buy signal. He looks up Apple’s
          								earnings and sees that Apple is posting “strong” earnings, and he deems it undervalued.
          								He buys the stock.<br/><br/>								And then the stock falls. Bigtime.<br/><br/>								What went wrong?<br/><br/>								The scapegoat answer would be to say something along the lines of how the markets are
          								random in nature, and therefore, it’s completely acceptable for the trade to have gone
          								wrong. We are not arguing that the markets should not have fallen. What we are arguing,
          								however, is that the idea of Apple having a need to form a “W” is nonsensical, unless
          								Mitch has a very clear reason as to why he feels the W is a consequence of a more
          								nuanced approach to the situation. If Mitch was to make his decision based on intimate
          								knowledge of Apple’s underlying supply/demand levels through the formation of each “W”,
          								and he could substantively prove that he had access to certain pieces of information
          								before others (highly unlikely) — then, he could potentially make the claim that his
          								model was expected to work. Otherwise, he needs to validate any sort of idea with more
          								concrete information, such as the Sharpe Ratio, win:loss ratio, etc.<br/><br/>								In conclusion, when trading the financial/capital markets, context is key, specifically
          								with regards to how a trader goes about defending her/his trading decision in terms of
          								having access to information disparity. If the argument is that, despite not having any
          								sort of advantage to any such information, this situation simply “exists”, then this
          								argument can be difficult to back up unless backed with a decent sample size of real
          								trades in conjunction with a sound argument as to how, and why, the state exists.<br/><br/>								Anything otherwise is simply too good to be true.<br/><br/>								The author is a Cofounder at RAIN Technologies, an AI driven fund management company.
