          Why Hedge Funds (Like RAIN) Have the Potential to Consistently
          Outperform the Best Mutual Funds
        </h1><img class="blog-img3" src="images/blog1.jpeg" style="width:100%;"/>
        <p class="para-blog2">
          I once had a brilliant University Finance professor tell his students (including me)
          that the stock markets are completely random in nature. When I raised my hand and asked
          him to explain Warren Buffett’s track record, he replied that statistically, Warren
          Buffett is just an outlier. His analogy was that if I flipped a coin ten times, I still
          have a ((1/2)^(10)) = (~0.1% chance) of landing all heads (or all tails). Therefore,
          this event should not be considered “extraordinary” since the sample size of
          participants can be large enough to realistically produce an extreme result.<br/>But I disagreed (and also got a C in the class), but I knew that he was wrong: you
          cannot simply dismiss Buffett’s stellar track record as just another random (however
          unlikely) event. Later, in my prop trading days, I learned that opportunities are always
          there for the taking. It is your job as an investor/trader/quant to seek out the
          opportunity before others and capitalize on it. I learned this early on, and it still
          applies today. Opportunities are everywhere.<br/>But not everybody has equal access to all opportunities. Most of the time, most people
          are looking at the same exact things in life, and this is one of the major reasons why
          similar sized mutual funds will typically not greatly outperform one another on a large
          scale. Over a 10 year horizon, good luck finding a large-cap equity mutual fund which
          performed consistently much better than its peers!<br/>The reason is simple. You can take any random large-cap fund and break it down into its
          constituents. Since it is a large-cap fund, you’re dealing with the largest of
          companies, all with significantly higher trade volumes than the other thinly, “risky”,
          lower market cap stocks. When it comes to investing, the only way to consistently beat
          the markets is to have an edge which can be relied upon, over and over again. Since
          large-cap mutual funds are looking at the largest of stocks, you have to really wonder
          exactly what it is that the fund is bringing to the table. Is it really likely that the
          fund is able to pick up on information more efficiently than the overall stock markets
          when it is only dealing with the largest of companies?<br/>It is unlikely.xx<br/>Both in Warren Buffett’s case with Berkshire Hathaway and in James Simons’ case with
          Renaissance Technologies, the bet was that by doing things in an unconventional way and
          by being smart with how they quantified risk, the firms had opportunities to
          consistently beat the stock markets in the long run. Of course, they have both more than
          surpassed their expectations. Our hope is that, when it’s all said and done, RAIN can be
          mentioned along with the lines of these two legendary titans in having found a way to
          consistently generate stellar returns for its investors.
