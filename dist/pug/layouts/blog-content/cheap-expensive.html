        Portfolio Management
        <p class="para-blog2"></p>When we go to Amazon to shop and buy products, the rationale is simple. I pay X dollars
        in order to purchase product Y. In my mind,
        it’s a very simple one to one connection.<br/><br/>	When you “pay” to buy shares of a company, it gets a bit more tricky. Who gets to set
        	that price, and what is it based on? Well,
        	we know the markets set the price—the question is, how good of a job is the market
        	doing, and are there any tools we can use
        	to access this quality of judgement?
        <p class="para-blog2" style="font-style:italic;"></p>In the stock markets, a company’s Earnings
        Per Share, or EPS, measures the profitability of a company. So if the “Price” is 100, a
        company’s EPS may be 1, which means that it generates
        one dollar in profit per share issued (at a price of 100).
        <p class="para-blog2"></p>Therefore, we can just look at EPS, right? If the EPS of Apple is high, it must mean
        that it is doing really well!<br/><br/>	Not so fast—because, in anticipation of this, the market also uses a “Price/Earnings”
        	ratio (also known as a P/E ratio) to “gauge” what the multiplier used should be in order
        	to generate the right price. So, if the EPS is 1, and the P/E is 15, then the price of
        	the stock is 15.<br/><br/>	So now, we’ve got a tricky situation: the price of a stock is not only based on its
        	earnings potential (EPS), but also on a relatively arbitrary measure (P/E) which creates
        	a multiplier in order to access the quality of a company. Some companies have higher P/E
        	ratios than others, and others have a higher EPS.<br/><br/>	This is a problem, isn’t it? I cannot just like at a company’s fundamentals and decide
        	on whether or not to buy, because its P/E may be too expensive. In other words, the
        	market may have not only priced this information in, but may have exaggerated this
        	assessment, which leads to the difficult situation on having no clue on whether or not a
        	company’s price is too high, or too low.<br/><br/><strong>Enter: The Nifty</strong><br/>	The Nifty is just a broad, generalized assessment of the overall stock market
        	performance in India. The logic is simple: if the Nifty goes up, the economy is doing
        	well. This is how we all think about the Nifty (and any stock market index).<br/><br/>	But what if the Nifty is overvalued, simply due to an inflated P/E by the market? In
        	other words, what if the market is simply wrong on its current assessment of the Nifty’s
        	P/E, regardless of how well it truly is performing?<br/><br/>	If this seems difficult to understand, take a minute and digest this. Sometimes, a
        	picture speaks a thousand words!<br/><img class="blog-img3" src="images/1_yRwbfwjyLtA8bJmOGdJJ3A.png" style="width:100%;"/><br/>	The blue line indicates the Nifty P/E, and the red line indicates the Nifty’s EPS.
        	Knowing this, is it a good time or a bad time to invest in the Nifty?<br/><br/>	The way you answer that question may say a lot about how you view the pricing mechanism
        	behind the stock markets.<br/><br/>	The author is a Cofounder at RAIN Technologies, an AI driven fund management company.
