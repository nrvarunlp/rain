              In early-mid December 2019, around a dozen or so individuals checked themselves into hospitals around the city of Wuhan, the sprawling capital of Hubei province in central China. They complained of viral-pneumonia like symptoms which included a high fever, a severe cough, and shortness of breathing. As it turned out, they had all been infected with 2019-nCoV, or what we all now know as the novel coronavirus which has kept the world's collective population in an extreme, fearful state of mind. These were the first reported cases, and since then, almost 30,000 more individuals have contracted the virus worldwide.

My introduction to algorithmic trading was in 2005 during my sophomore year at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where as an uninspired 19-year-old, I was seriously starting to question the merits of my decision to pursue a career in Actuarial Science. I had no interest in becoming an actuary, but didn't know what else I should be doing.

                    Another decade has officially flown by. Poof, that’s 10 years gone from your life.
                    Where did all that time go?
                    Hopefully, you were able to take advantage of those 3652 days in a financially prudent manner! From a diversification perspective, it would have made sense to at least plow some of your money into stocks and take advantage of the strong performance stock markets (in general) exhibited through the past 10 years. This is especially true considering the fact that the 2008 global financial meltdown was behind us. Regulators around the world, of course, went into a scramble in 2008 since the US housing crisis severely impacted the stock markets in the United States. The meltdown also led to sharp contractions on other nations’ equity bourses, including in India where the BSE Sensex fell by almost 50% from peak to trough.

                  <p class="para-blog">Two weeks ago, we published an article discussing the current, fast developing US-China Trade War. It highlighted the fact that while a trade war may feel like the right thing to get behind, it in fact hurts economies and can lead to devastating consequences. An example of a “tariff hungry” situation gone bad was with the passing of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930, which was originally introduced to help US farmers stay competitive against farmers in Europe through the imposition of tariffs on European imported agricultural goods. However, it led to a devastating trade war between the US and all of Europe in general, which prolonged the effect of the Great Depression. There are more effective means a country can use to keep its domestic constituents competitive against international forces such as the use of subsidies and imposing quotas on goods.</p><a class="btn btn-primary read-btn" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/trading-idea-week-buying-usdcnh-at700-raghu-kumar/">Read More</a>

It is also unilaterally responsible for how you perceive, interpret, and react with the world. The brain can further be compartmentalized into areas which focus on conscious activity being driven by your five senses, which is how you are making sense of the external world, and the areas which produce all your subconscious thought, which is essentially everything that is on “autopilot”.</p><a class="btn btn-primary read-btn" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-our-subconscious-impacts-trading-decisions-raghu-kumar/">Read More</a>

                    I once had a brilliant University Finance professor tell his students (including me) that the stock markets are completely

                    Warren Buffett is just an outlier. His analogy was that if I flipped a coin ten times, I still have a ((1/2)^(10)) = (~0.1% chance) of
                    landing all heads (or all tails). Therefore, this event should not be considered “extraordinary” since the sample size of participants

                  <p class="para-blog">
                    Last week, we posted this on a Thursday. The article’s premise was simple: using a simple graph of the Nifty’s EPS
                    (Earnings Per Share) charted against it’s P/E (Price to Earnings Ratio), it becomes evident that a sharp correction in
                    the Nifty should not be surprising due to an inherent truth: the price of the Nifty is nothing more than a general,
                    wild speculation by all of us. On Friday, the Nifty fell 282 points, the largest one day drop in more than three years.......

                    In the business world, I respect Elon Musk a lot, mostly because he seems to deeply care about the future of humanity.
                    Another individual I respect is Dr. Neil Degrasse Tyson, the popular astrophysicist who has found a way to make science
                    cool again. Both Musk and Tyson share a belief which may lead you to question everything you know about everything.
                    They both think we are living in a world more akin to Neo’s world in the ‘Matrix’ than the “real’ world we think we are
                    living in today.....

                  <p class="para-blog">
                    People often have a hard time understanding how the stock markets work and behave. What drives the stock price
                    of a company? What is the foundation for that stock price, and how does one profit from that information? As our world evolves
                    into one which fully embraces Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, we tend to prefer processes wherein we have
                    full control over the outcome........

                    You were probably not expecting a quote from the Bible to spearhead an article on profitable portfolio management,
                    but that’s besides the point. The quote is relevant because it paints a truth about life in plain and stark terms: you will
                    find what you’re looking for. OK, it might not be quite that simple. I cannot begin trading and proclaim: I am guaranteed
                    to make money trading today! But I can find what I’m looking for, meaning, I fully validate and justify any trading strategy
                    based on historical, past information.......

                    When we go to Amazon to shop and buy products, the rationale is simple. I pay X
                    dollars in order to purchase product Y. In my mind, it’s a very simple one to one connection. When you “pay”
                    to buy shares of a company, it gets a bit more tricky. Who gets to set that price, and what is it based on? Well,
                    we know the markets set the price the question is, how good of a job is the market doing, and are there
